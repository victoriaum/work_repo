    ) as reserve2,

  // after change
    COUNT(
        CASE WHEN status <> 'Cancel' 
        AND (Role_ID != 'RLE00008' OR Role_ID IS NULL) THEN 1 END
    ) as reserve2, 
  ```
  + need to memorize that compare varchar type based on compared value is not empty value(null). so, if it is null this condition is not considerable in conditions.
  + so, if you want to get data except on something varchar value, should be included the null value.
