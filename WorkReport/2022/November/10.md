### Attached file name issue
+ Needs : Korean, English, Figures are complexes into file name.
+ Details : First, Korean is broken and also extension is disappeared. 
+ Method :
  1. In this case, I did few things, but it didn't work
     1. Change the encoding charset -> ```EUC-KR``` to ```UTF-8```
     2. Fixed file name setting
     3. In Extension, change ```.``` to ```&#46;```

  2. Coworker's advice
     1. Adjust ```EUC-KR``` for Korean and add remain String file name.
     ```java
     messageBodyPart.setFileName(MimeUtility.encodeText(fileName, "EUC-KR", "B") + fileName2);
     ```
  ```
