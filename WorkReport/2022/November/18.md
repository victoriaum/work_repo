### Check follow up
+ Operate server release schedule?

### Run project using Winsw program - Continued
+ Needs : Winsw program tests in local environment.
+ Method :
  1. Using Winsw program
     1. register .bat file in ```<executable>``` tag
     ```xml
        <service>
           <id>jenkins</id>
           <name>Jenkins</name>
           <description>This service runs Jenkins continuous integration system.</description>
           <env name="JENKINS_HOME" value="%BASE%"/>
           <executable>java</executable>
           <arguments>-Xrs -Xmx256m -jar "%BASE%\jenkins.war" --httpPort=8080</arguments>
           <log mode="roll"></log>
        </service>
     ```
+ Tried Method : 
  1. Just change .bat file to .exe and install .exe as a service. But, the operating time is too long and 1053 error occurred.
     1. Also, using the registry editor and changed timeout time to 180000 but, it doesn't work. ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control```
     2. That number of 180000 is larger than just bootrun on console... So, it is not a quiet great solution if it works by changing timeout to more than 200000. Also, I have no idea it makes other service not working properly...
  2. I found that there is method using embedded tomcat in linux server.
     1. Need to find the solution that fit in window server.

  + [Linux commander using embedded tomcat](https://blog.naver.com/writer0713/221542130445)
  ```cmd
  // In linux server, run project in background using internal tomcat
  $ nohup ./gradlew bootrun > app.log 2>&1 &
  ```
