+ Needs : Image need to show clearly
+ Details : In Chrome browser there is a broken image issue with security issue. Need to solve them. However, there is no same issue with Explorer Edge.
+ Condition and Method :
  1. Auto Mailing with batch system
  ```java  
  @Component
  @Slf4j
  public class Tasks {
      @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 7 * * ?")  // using corn expression -> every 7 a.m.
      public void autoMailingStatistics() throws Exception {
          SMSService smsService = null;
          smsService.autoMailingStatistics();
          log.info("일일입고현황 통계 메일링 테스트중:" + DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyyMMddhhmmss").format(LocalDateTime.now()));
      }
  }
  ```
  2. If yesterday is workplace's holiday, do not send statistics because there is no report to send managers.
  3. To confirm user has email address or not.
  4. These works operate in Service Layer, So need to access link with Java. If user requests this url(http in below code), download .xls file.
  ```Java
  @Service
  public class SMSService {
     public void downloader(String http){
        BufferedReader in = null;
        try {
            URL obj = new URL(http);
            HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection)obj.openConnection();
            con.setRequestMethod("GET");
            in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream(), "UTF-8"));
            String line;
            while((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            if(in != null) try { in.close(); } catch(Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
        }
     }
  }
  ```
  5. The person who accept this mail need to get just his/her workplace's statistics only.
  6. Download folder in other directory divided by date.
+ Consider :
  1. Where to make download directory folders.
  2.
  
### ETC
+ Report progress to manager.
