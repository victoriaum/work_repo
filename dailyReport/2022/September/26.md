### Check follow up
+ Meeting for DB performance issue.

### Statistics - 01
+ Needs : check the figures are correct or not
+ Method :
    1. First, order them with their center name alphabetically 
    2. Test them to check figures are right counted. -> need to check again
  
### Statistics - 02
+ Needs : calculate data about remain period compare to reservation date.
+ Method :
  1. Just set intuitive query.
     + first, I tried to use temp select query but, the query condition should be checked in first temp. So, that makes benefit doesn't work for using temp query cause temp query using for be select fixed option value for the result performance better. 
  2. Test them to check figures when search value is not null -> need to check again
