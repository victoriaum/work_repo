### Edit error case
> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value')
+ Needs : Set input data originally
+ Detail : The value hasn't showed up. it worked well at the past.
+ Method :
  1. Debug
  2. Find that some changes not reflected in other related pages. So, there is an error caused by js.
     1. We changed three phone number inputs to one because of customer needs.
     2. Some pages still use three inputs yet, so change them to use just one input value.

### Make additional function
+ Needs : New page for set day off schedule of all centers like national holidays.
+ Detail : 
  1. We have day off managing function for each center. But, customer company's worker who works in IT or Planning department wants to set common holidays for all centers.
  2. So, we need new view pages for additional function.
  3. Set page almost same with existing day off managing page.
+ Method :
  1. Set view pages.
  2. Erase don't use part or method, css, etc..
  3. Check set holiday for all centers and DB for testing
+ Additional Works Needed
  1. period settings for multiple holiday and workers day-off schedules. just one day setting allows on current status.
  2. except code '000' day off schedule when get reservation schedule.

### ETC
+ build schedule at 22nd lunch.
