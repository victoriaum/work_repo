### DB Unique NonClustered Index Setting
+ Needs : need to prevent duplicate row and allows multi Nulls.
+ Detail : we prevented almost all the cases with server based method (controller, service etc.). but need to check on the DB level to prevent duplicate issue.
+ Method :
    1. Therefore, unique value can be managed by unique key, constraint, nonClustered Index
    2. To allow multi Nulls, choose nonClustered Index
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX index_rsvt_WorksheetId
  ON dbo.[Reservations](WorksheetId)
  WHERE WorksheetId IS NOT NULL;
  
  CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX index_rsvt_CompositeKey
  ON dbo.[Reservations](CenterCode, ReservationDate, ReservationTime, TbUser_ID)
  WHERE ReservationTime IS NOT NULL AND TbUser_ID IS NOT NULL AND STATUS <> 'Cancel';
  ```
