### Debugging - Statistics error
+ Needs : some information is not correct
+ Method :
  1. Check SQL and change the select values.
  ```roomsql
  // before change
    COUNT(
        CASE WHEN status <> 'Cancel' 
        AND Role_ID != 'RLE00008' THEN 1 END
    ) as reserve2, 
  ```
  ```roomsql  
  // after change
    COUNT(
        CASE WHEN status <> 'Cancel' 
        AND (Role_ID != 'RLE00008' OR Role_ID IS NULL) THEN 1 END
    ) as reserve2, 
  ```
  + need to memorize that compare varchar type based on compared value is not empty value(null). so, if it is null this condition is not considerable in conditions.
  + so, if you want to get data except on something varchar value, should be included the null value.

### ETC
+ following additional function developing schedule
