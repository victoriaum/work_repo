### Check follow up
+ Release schedule? -> Nope.

### Issue - Login error
+ Needs : Few access trial failed because of lots of user accessed in the same time.
+ Details : from 9AM to 10AM contact flow  to webpage is no good.
+ Method : 
  1. Is not a query performance issue cause this page spends query performance time for just 0.3 min at least.
  2. Umm... This page is reloading in each minute. That cause memory leak.
  3. There is a solution to increase the interval time.
  4. Or, need to alert when more than 5 minutes passed to reload page by themselves.
  5. Or, just showing the time that this page first requested from user.
  6. Or, decrease the information to shown to the user. (Lots of information served to users in present.)
